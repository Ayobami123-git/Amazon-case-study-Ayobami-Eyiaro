The following cleaning and preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the data for analysis:

I removed Redundancy and Duplicates:
Duplicate product_id entries were dropped to ensure product uniqueness.

Handled Missing Values
Rows with missing actual_price, discounted_price, or Product Category were removed or corrected.

Standardized Column Formats:
I ensured all monetary columns (discounted_price, actual_price) were treated as numeric types.
I reformatted inconsistent category naming (e.g., spacing and symbols).

Calculated Discount Percentage:
I created a new discount_percentage column using the formula:

DiscountÂ %
=
ActualÂ Price
âˆ’
DiscountedÂ Price
ActualÂ Price
Ã—
100
DiscountÂ %= ActualÂ Priceâˆ’DiscountedÂ PriceÃ—100

ðŸ“Š Average Discount Percentage by Product Category
	Product Category	Average Discount (%)
	Home Improvement	57.5%
	Computers & Accessories	53.1%
	Health & PersonalCare	53.0%
	Electronics	49.9%
 	Musical Instruments	46.0%
	Car & Motorbike	42.0%
 	Home & Kitchen	40.2%
	Office Products	12.4%
	Toys & Games	0.0%


Home Improvement products had the highest average discount rate at 57.5%.

Toys & Games had no recorded discounts, indicating possible exclusion from promotional strategies.

Categories like Computers & Accessories and Electronics are highly discounted, likely due to competitive tech markets.
